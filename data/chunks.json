Decent work\nmeans\nbuilding a culture of equality and inclusion at work,\nand ensuring everyone’s voices are valued and heard.\nDecent\nwork means acknowledging the highly gendered nature\nof the nonproﬁt sector’s workforce – and developing\nsolutions that address women’s particular interests\nand concerns.\nThrough adopting decent work practices, your organization\nwill be better able to meet your mission and contribute\nto thriving communities. And in doing so, you help\nbuild a stronger, more resilient nonproﬁt sector.\nThe above text is used with permission of the Ontario\nNon-Proﬁt Network.

The purpose\nof this policy is to outline the employee’s and\nthe Foundation’s insurance coverage when an employee\nuses their own vehicle for Foundation\nbusiness. In this instance the Foundation’s insurance\ncoverage must include non-owned auto. The\npolicy also applies to volunteers using their automobile\non Foundation business. The Foundation’s\nnon-owned auto coverage limit needs to be substituted\nfor the limits in the policy below. The\nFoundation also needs to get conﬁrmation from their\nemployee or volunteer that they are suitably\ninsured.\nPolicy and Procedure Statement\nWhen an employee or volunteer is using a personal\nvehicle while on Foundation business, their personal\nauto\ninsurance is the primary insurer. The Foundation’s\nlimit for non-owned automobiles is $2 million. This\nis paid in\nexcess of the underlying automobile insurance for\nthe owner of said vehicle.\nFor example, if the employee has an underlying liability\nlimit of $1 million (as is typical) and uses a personal\nvehicle\nfor Foundation purposes and a claim is substantiated\nin the amount of $2.5 million, the owner’s automobile\npolicy\nwould pick up the ﬁrst $1 million and the Foundation’s\ninsurance would pick up the additional $1.5 million.\nContact with media\nMedia relations are important for the Foundation as",
